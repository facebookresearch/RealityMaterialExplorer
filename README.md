# Description
We present RealityMaterialExplorer in VR,  a Quest 2 app that enables real-time viewing and editing of BRDF models in a simple scene. We are motivated to validate the visual impact of physically based material models in VR/AR and inspired by the Open Source Disney BRDF Explorer for desktop that was fundamental to the development of “Disney BRDF” material model that has become the industry standard for PBR materials.

RealityMaterialExplorer VR is designed for users to evaluate and compare their perception of the realistic material models using 100 measured materials from the MERL database.  It can also be used by researchers and 3D content artists to develop intuition and insight about these 4D BRDF models (the essential function for capturing how surfaces reflect light) that can lead to new research and applications.
# Using this Repo
This app has been developed in Unity.  After cloning, you should be able to open the "RealityMaterialExplorer" folder as a Unity project.  We used Unity version 2019.4 (LTS).
